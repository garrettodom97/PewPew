This project is a Galaga style video game that I created.

The game has a player spacecraft which can move in 4 directions and can fire lasers at a controlled rate.
The game spawns enemies on set intervals that also shoot lasers. The eneimes can be killed by a laser shot colliding with them,
earning the player a point. The enemies spawn at random locations at the top of the screen.
A heavy enemy periodically spawns in the middle of the screen and stops all other enemies from spawning. 
The heavy enemy shoots four lasers and takes four hits to kill, earning the player 5 points. 
The game continues until the player comes in contact with an enemy laser and dies.

The main menu allows you to either start the game, view the contorls for the game, or exit the game.
Once in the game, you can press "p" to pause or "m" to mute the game. 
After the player loses, the game over screen will display their score and allow them to return to the main menu.

The script also reads in high scores from a text file, updates the scores if necessary, and prints them to a new text file that replaces the old one.

The spacecraft class represents the player. It has methods to display, move, shoot each half of the laser, check for death, and explode.
The enemy1 class represents the small enemies. It has methods to display, move, shoot, check for death, and explode.
The enemy2 class represents the heavy enemies. It has methods to display, move, shoot all four lasers, check for a hit, check for death, and explode.
The laser class represents both enemy and player lasers. It has methods to display and move.
